## Community Evaluations

The Meshtastic Antenna Reports repository started as a project by [RicInNewMexico](https://github.com/RicInNewMexico) before being officially transferred to the Meshtastic organization. It contains testing reports and evaluations of various antennas commonly used with Meshtastic devices, contributed by members of the community.

These users have gone through the effort of testing and providing their opinions on whether specific antennas perform optimally with Meshtastic devices.

If you wish to contribute a testing report or evaluation, please review the contribution guidelines in the [Meshtastic Antenna Reports](https://github.com/meshtastic/antenna-reports) Github repository.
